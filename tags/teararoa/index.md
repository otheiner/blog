description: Te Araroa is a long-distance trail that crosses the entire length of New Zealand. The average time to hike the trail is between four and five months, and hikers cover more than 3,000 km with over 80,000 m of elevation gain. I hiked Te Araroa in 2025, and this is a collection of articles about my journey to Mordor.
