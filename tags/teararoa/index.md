description: Te Araroa is long-distance trail crossing the whole length of New Zealand. The average time to huke the trail is between four to five months and hikers cover more than 3000 km with more than 80 000 m of positive elevation gain. I hiked Te Araroa in 2025 and this is the collection of articles about my journey to Mordor.
