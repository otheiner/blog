description: In 2017, I traveled with my brother from the Czech Republic to Venice. But it wasn’t the typical journey most tourists to Italy take. We didn’t use a car, bus, or plane — I went by scooter (kickbike) and my brother went by bike. We slept outdoors and covered 700 km in about seven days. Since then, my brother and I have done several other big trips (mostly by scooter and bike, but we’ve also hiked), and since we’re two brothers traveling together, we started calling our expeditions BroBro Trip. You can check out our <a href=https://www.instagram.com/brobro_trip/?hl=cs>Instagram</a>, which is active only when we’re on a BroBro Trip, but you can still find some cool pictures from our journeys there.
