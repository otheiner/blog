description: Scooter, kickbike, trotinette, koloběžka, hulajnoga,... these are names in different languages for a vehicle that I've ridden so much. I participated in competitions, such as <a href=https://ceskykolobeh.cz/kolobezkove-souteze/>Rollo liga</a> in the Czech Republic, which is the oldest scooter competition in the world. But apart from competing, I used a scooter for covering large distances with the backpack on my back and these has been some of my greatest adventures so far. Posts in this category are about my scooter adventures and everything related.
