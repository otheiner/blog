description: Scooter, kickbike, trotinette, koloběžka, hulajnoga... these are names in different languages for a vehicle I’ve ridden a lot. I’ve participated in competitions such as the <a href=https://ceskykolobeh.cz/kolobezkove-souteze/>Rollo liga</a> in the Czech Republic, which is the oldest scooter competition in the world. But apart from competing, I’ve also used a scooter to cover long distances with a backpack on my back, and those have been some of my greatest adventures so far. Posts in this category are about my scooter adventures and everything related.
