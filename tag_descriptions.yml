hiking: |
  I love being in the mountains, or simply in nature, and hiking is the activity that allows me to spend time actively out there. These posts are a collection of some of my hiking adventures.
TeAraroa: |
  Te Araroa is a long-distance trail that crosses the entire length of New Zealand. The average time to hike the trail is between four and five months, and hikers cover more than 3,000 km with over 80,000 m of elevation gain. I hiked Te Araroa in 2025, and this is a collection of articles about my journey to Mordor.
scooter: |
  Scooter, kickbike, trotinette, koloběžka, hulajnoga... these are names in different languages for a vehicle I’ve ridden a lot. I’ve participated in competitions such as the <a href=https://ceskykolobeh.cz/kolobezkove-souteze/>Rollo liga</a> in the Czech Republic, which is the oldest scooter competition in the world. But apart from competing, I’ve also used a scooter to cover long distances with a backpack on my back, and those have been some of my greatest adventures so far. Posts in this category are about my scooter adventures and everything related.
BroBro: |
In 2017, I traveled with my brother from the Czech Republic to Venice. But it wasn’t the typical journey most tourists to Italy take. We didn’t use a car, bus, or plane — I went by scooter (kickbike) and my brother went by bike. We slept outdoors and covered 700 km in about seven days. Since then, my brother and I have done several other big trips (mostly by scooter and bike, but we’ve also hiked), and since we’re two brothers traveling together, we started calling our expeditions BroBro Trip. You can check out our <a href=https://www.instagram.com/brobro_trip/?hl=cs>Instagram</a>, which is active only when we’re on a BroBro Trip, but you can still find some cool pictures from our journeys there.
