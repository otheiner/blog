hiking: |
  I love being in the mountains, or simply in the nature, and hiking is the activity that allows me to spend time actively out there. These posts are collections of some of my hiking adventures.
TeAraroa: |
  Te Araroa is long-distance trail crossing the whole length of New Zealand. The average time to huke the trail is between four to five months and hikers cover more than 3000 km with more than 80 000 m of positive elevation gain. I hiked Te Araroa in 2025 and this is the collection of articles about my journey to Mordor.
scooter: |
  Scooter, kickbike, trotinette, koloběžka, hulajnoga,... these are names in different languages for a vehicle that I've ridden so much. I participated in competitions, such as <a href=https://ceskykolobeh.cz/kolobezkove-souteze/>Rollo liga</a> in the Czech Republic, which is the oldest scooter competition in the world. But apart from competing, I used a scooter for covering large distances with the backpack on my back and these has been some of my greatest adventures so far. Posts in this category are about my scooter adventures and everything related.
BroBro: |
  In 2017, I travelled with my brother from the Czech Republic to Venice. But it wasn't the typical journey that most of the tourist to Italy take. We didn't use car, bus, or plane, but I went by scooter (kickbike) and my brother went by bike. We slept outdoors and we covered 700 km in about 7 days. Since then, my brother and I did some other big trips (mostly by scooter and bike, but we also hiked) and since we are two brothers on the trip, we started calling our expeditions BroBro trip. You can check out our <a href=https://www.instagram.com/brobro_trip/?hl=cs>Instagram</a> which is active only when we are on BroBro trip, but you can still find there some cool pictures from our journeys.
