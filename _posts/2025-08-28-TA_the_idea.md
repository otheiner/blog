It was April 2024 and I was sitting in my office at the University of Geneva. I was analysing data from the ATLAS experiment at CERN where my colleagues and I were looking for new elementary particles called Higgsinos. It was the time when we were preparing paper and I was also already working on chapters for my disertation. A little bit stresful times and I wanted to see the light at the end of the tunnel, so I started to think what am I going to do after I defend my thesis. I knew that I wanted to do some adventure and I wanted it to be big!

## The first idea

Inspired by my previous adventures on scooter which I did mostly before I started my studies in Geneva, I wanted to do something similar. The problem was that I knew that I am going to finish my doctorate in October and in Europe it is already starting to be cold. Adventure for a week or two would still be possible in October but since I wanted to do something that I won't be able to do when I have a job, which means leaving for several months, the winter was a problem. But I got an idea! Why not going proper big and go somewhere far, somewhere in southern hemisphere where would be summer at that time? And this was exactly the moment when I started thinking about New Zealand. I always wanted to visit this country, it has beautiful nature, mountains, and I even had a few friends who visited New Zealand not long time before. Now the question was what to do there?

New Zealand is not so big. If I decided to it on my scooter or by bike, it would be a shorter trip than [3 800 km across Europe]({{ '/2019/09/01/BroBro_Nordkapp.html' | relative_url }}) from the Czech Republic to Nordkapp and I wanted to do something bigger, so I started thinking about walking. The idea of a long thru hike was in my mind for a long time. I attended some slideshows about three famous long distance trails in America (PCT, CDT, Apalachian trail) in the past and it seemed completely unreal to me how someone can hike for 5 months. But this idea got stuck in my head and it was sitting there for many years. So I went to Google and searched for something like "New Zealand thru hiking" and, to my surprise, there was a trail called Te Araroa and it was crossing the whole country. When I saw it, I immediately liked the idea, but I didn't do more planning. This idea was actually in back of my mind since then and when I defended my thesis at the end of October 2024, I didn't have any other plan for a big adventure but Te Araroa seemed like a great plan which I decided to turn into reality.

## What is Te Araroa trail?

Te Araroa in Māori language means "The long pathway" which perfectly describes the trail. It is 3040 km long path which crosses both the North and South Islands, with more than 80 000 meters of positive elevation gain. According to the trail webpage, about 2 000 hikers finish the trail every year in one continuous push and many others walk just sections of it and the average time to hike the whole trail is usually between 4 to 5 months. Even though it is not as popular as big trails in America, it is gaining its popularity. 

The trail starts in the north of North Island at Cape Reinga and finishes in south of South Island in Bluff. At least this is the direction of the trail which most of the people choose. The main reason for this is that part of the trail involes floating about 150 kilometers down the river on canoe and the direction river flow gives the trail direction. This direction is refered as southbound or in the trail slang simply "SOBO". However, the other direction is also possible but with a little trail modification, which I will talk about later in this series. This direction is refered to as northbound - in trail slang also known as "NOBO".

Based on which direction one decides to choose, the suitable time window for hiking the differes. For SOBO, the ideal time to start the trail is around October-December. The reason for this is that starting earlier means hiking in winter which, in North Island, means a lot of rains. On the other hand, starting later means that one arrives to mountains in South Island in autumn and there can be snow already. The window for starting NOBO is usually later because snow in moutains in South Island melts in summer, so it is possible to start around December-January. Finishing in autumn in the North Island is not a problem because the area north of Auckland (approximately last 600 km) is reffered to as winterless north, and eventhough it can be raining, there are not many potentially dangerous sections and so the north is doable almost all-year long.
