After spending a week in Auckland before starting the trail, it was finally time to set out on the journey. I took a plane to Invercargill, in the south of the South Island, and from there I hitched a ride to Bluff, where the trail begins. Hitchhiking wasn’t my original plan, but after finding out that I should have booked the shuttle service a day in advance—which I hadn’t done—I had no other option. Luckily, after just a few minutes, I was picked up by Maxi, an Argentinian guy who had been in New Zealand for a year and had arrived with zero knowledge of English. His English was actually quite good, considering he had started learning only a year ago. It was also a great opportunity for me to brush up on my Spanish, so we had a fun conversation in Spenglish—a mix of Spanish and English.
