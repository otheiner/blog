I never thought that travelling by scooter across Europe, can potentially change someone's life for better. But this is exacty what happened and I want to share this story. Our story about the big scooter trip from the Czech Republic to Norway evolved into something that we didn't expected. If you've read my older [post]({{ '/2019/09/01/BroBro_Nordkapp.html' | relative_url }}), you know that when we were leaving Nordkapp, we were stopped by the belgian journalist Michael Van Peel who interviewd us for his podcast. The podcast was never published because Michael decided to use the material in another way. He collected stories of many people who arrived at Nordkapp using unusual means of transport and he decided to publish these stories in form of short interviews in a book called "Nordkapp Stories".

The book was published during the times of covid pandemic, and Michael even sent us one copy of the book with a dedication.

It was a nice feeling to be able to hold this book. We were in the book with other crazy travellers by a pure lucky coincidence but it was great to be able to hold this little souvenir from our crazy journey we did in 2019. If this was already the end of the story, we would be happy. But it was not.

At the begining of September, we unexpectedly received e-mail from Michael. I was happy to see that he still remebered us, so I quickly read the email and when I finished reading, I was feeling a bit emotional. He wanted to know how we are doing but the main reason why he was writing us was the e-mail he received from someone. This man was grateful for the inspiring book and, in particular, he was mentioning our story as the one, which helped his friend to regain a little bit of autonomy after he suffered bad injury.

This is the e-mail:

>Hi Michael,
>
>I wanted to let you know that your book "Nordkapp Stories" is particularly inspiring. 
>Not only because of the quality of the text and photos, but it also helped my friend 
>significantly.
>
>Just to clarify: my friend fell off his bike almost 5 (!) years ago and suffered a 
>double pubic bone fracture. Unfortunately, the diagnosis wasn't made until 7 weeks 
>after the fall, and he's still in terrible pain to this day (probably due to internal 
>adhesions involving nerves). The pain is overwhelming, incurable, and prevents him 
>from sitting. He was an avid cyclist, and the fact that he can no longer do that 
>is hard.
>
>Now, back to your book. I saw the photo of the duo with the kickbike. That led
>us to test an electric version in the Netherlandsâ€”the cycle paths are just a 
>tad better there than in Flanders. That was a revelation. For him, it was the
>first time in five years that he could drive something, and also the most spectacular 
>thing he'd done in five years. He's now going to buy an e-kickbike himself so he
>can regain a little of his autonomy. I just wanted to let you know.
>
>Best regards, <br>
>...

I have to say that this message made me incredibly happy. I love adventures but I am also aware that being able to do similar things is kind of a privilage and I try to keep that in mind. I am healthy, I have time, and I am at stage of my life when I can allow myself to do these things. It is not always easy and it needs some dedication but that's my choice. I choose to do it, but there are people who can't, even if they wanted to. And so knowing that our story had positive impact on someone's life (and it doesn't matter it is a single person) is extemely fulfilling and makes me thing that seemingly silly activity, such as riding scooter, can help make this world slightly better place.
