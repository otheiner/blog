I was wondering how long I will have to go until I meet with some hiker going NOBO (northbound), which is what I am doing. It took exactly 10 minutes into the trail üòÅ and I met Chintamani and Nick who are from New Zealand. Good coincidence because we didn't meet any other NOBO hikers during the whole day. We started in the morning walking up Bluff hill and then continuing a long way along the road and sea shore to Invercargill where we arrived together. Since there are no places for sleeping in between, it was a quite long first day. A bit longer than what I wished for but we made it!
