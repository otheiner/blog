It was April 2024 and I was sitting in my office at the University of Geneva. I was analysing data from the ATLAS experiment at CERN where my colleagues and I were looking for new elementary particles called Higgsinos. It was the time when we were preparing paper and I was also already working on chapters for my disertation. A little bit stresful times and I wanted to see the light at the end of the tunnel, so I started to think what am I going to do after I finish my Ph.D. I knew that I wanted to do some adventure. And I wanted it to be big!

## The Idea

Inspired by my previous adventures on scooter which I did mostly before I started my studies in Geneva, I wanted to do something similar. The problem was that I knew that I am going to finish my doctorate in October and in Europe it is already starting to be cold. Adventure for a week or two would still be possible in October but since I wanted to do something that I won't be able to do when I have a job, which means leaving for several months, the winter was a problem. But I got an idea! Why not going proper big and go somewhere far, somewhere in southern hemisphere where would be summer at that time? And this was exactly the moment when I started thinking about New Zealand. I always wanted to visit this country, it has beautiful nature, mountains, and I even had a few friends who visited New Zealand not long time before. Now the question was what to do there?

New Zealand is not so big. If I wanted to cross it on my scooter or by bike, it would be a shorter trip than [3 800 km across Europe]({{Site.BaseUrl}}/2019/09/01/BroBro_Nordkapp.html) from the Czech Republic to Nordkapp. I also had in my mind idea of a long thru hike. I attended some slideshows about three famous long distance trails in America (PCT, CDT, Apalachian trail) in the past and it seemed completely unreal to me how someone can hike for 5 months. But this idea got stuck in my head and it was sitting there for many years.
