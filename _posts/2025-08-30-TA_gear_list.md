Well-packed stuff is the crucial element for finishing the trail. You should have everything you need and nothing you don't because you will feel every extra gram. I was seeing people with heavy backpacks at the beginning of the trail and as I went further, I was seeing less of these people and more people were really efficiently packed. My base weight (weight without water and food) was something between 7 and 8 kg. You can go deffinitely below this number (I met a few people who had base weight of 4 kg!) but you need to decide how much money you need to invest to your gear and what you are willing to give up. We can probably agree that caryying a camping chair for the evening chill is probably not very useful and you don't need to cary that. On the other had, having the second set of dry clothes in case you have to walk in the rain is, in my opinion, important. Imagine that you are walking the whole day in the rain, you are cold and you have no dry clothes to put on for the night. Base weight around 7 kg is a good number to aim for because you don't need to do a huge trade-offs in your gear if you pack smart, but it is also the weight which won't bother you too much when you carry it for a few months.

I don't consider myself as an expert on gear and packing. I am aware that many things could be improved but I didn't carry uselss gear and I think I had everything to survive 4 months in the nature of New Zealand. I am posting my gear list below. Don't take it as an advice but rather as an inspiration in case you need some

Happy trails!


## My gear list for the Te Araroa trail

### Backpacks and bags
* **backpack** (Hyperlite - 55 liters, tall version - this backpack is rainproof!)
* **dry bags** (to sort my stuff inside the backpack and make sure that things stay dry even if some water gets inside the backpack)

### Hygiene
* **toothbrush**
* **toothpaste**
* **sunscreen** (I had to buy a few during the trail)
* **gilette** (I didn't shave but it would be useful in case I needed to use kinesiotapes - body hairs and tapes don't work well together)
* **toilet paper**
* **poop shovel** (to burry your poop and make sure that animals don't spread feaces it to water sources)
* **little soap**
* **paper tissues**
* **small towel** (very light Sea To Summit towel)

### Clothes
* **small puffy jacket** (Patagonia)
* **shoes** (I had three pairs - the second and thirs were waiting for me on the trail)
* **thin gloves**
* **Buff** (can be used as beanie or protection against sun)
* **rainproof jacket** (three-layered PERTEX)
* **rainproof pants**
* **shorts**
* **long running leggings**
* **Merino shirt with long sleeve** (two times)
* **T-shirt with short sleeve** (for most of the hiking)
* **Merino underwear** (doesn't smell and keeps you warm even if it gets wet from the rain or river crossing.)
* **socks** (three pairs at the beginning but I had to buy a few more pairs because I started having holes in them)
* **trail cap with ðŸš€** (my secret weapon, source of energy and protection against the sun)

### Electronics
* **headlamp**
* **red light** (I bought it in the second half of the trail when there were a lot of road walking and I sometimes had to walk in a low visibility or in the dark)
* **powerbanks** (I had two, 10 000 mAh and 20 000 mAh, just to have one for my watch and the other for the phone. Keeping wqtch charged was important for navigation, phone mostly for pictures.)
* **solar panel** (Goal Zero - I wouldn't bring it next time to *this* trail. New Zealand is wild but I always had opportunity to recharge powerbanks almost every week.)
* **phone**
* **GPS watch** (Garmin Forerunner 945 - I used it for tracking and navigation)
* **various charging cables**
* **power adaptor with two USB sockets** (very useful when you are at the hostel and you need to recharge more devices)
* **headphones** (it is sometimes nice to listen to some music)
* **satelite phone** (Garmin Inreach Mini - this is must in case of potential rescue operation because New Zealand is poorly covered with mobile network)
* **Kindle** (I didn't use it much but always good to have option of doing something else than hiking the whole day)
* **power socket adaptor** (New Zealand to European)

### Sleeping
* **tarp** (Six Moon Design - Dechutes)
* **tyvek** (as a floor for the tarp)
* **sleeping mat** (Thermarest  NeoAir XLite - regular length, wider version)
* **sleeping bag** (Cumulus - comfort around 2Â° C)

### Others
* **diary** (I was writing a physical journal from the trail)
* **pen**
* **first aid kit** (plasters, active charcoal and other basic medications, sciscors, needles, thread, )
* **survival blanket**
* **hiking poles** (serve also as a support for the tarp)
* **water bladder** (2 liters)
* **water squeeze** filter (Sawyer)
* **siringe for cleening the water filter** (there's nothing worse than the filter with a bad flow)
* **water bottle** (Nalgene 1,5 l)
* **sunglasses**
* **knife**
* **cooker**
* **pot**
* **gas bottle for cooking** (it can't be in the plane, so I had to buy one just before starting the trail)
* **spoon**
* **lighter**
* **ziplock bags** (can be useful for various things - for example, storing food)
* **passport**
* **thin cord** (for hanging wet clother or minor repairs)
* **trash bag** (makes it easier to keep trash in one place)
