Hiking Tour du Mont Blanc has been on my list for quite some time. It was one of those activities that I knew I can do almost at any time because the hike is almost behind my door step, but it still required a little bit of preparation. However, after having hiked Te Araroa trail in New Zealand this year, the whole hike suddenly felt like a much smaller project than I percieved it before, so I only had to find a few days of a decent weather window.
