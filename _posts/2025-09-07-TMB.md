Hiking Tour du Mont Blanc (TMB) has been on my list for quite some time. It was one of those activities that I knew I can do almost at any time because the hike is almost behind my door step, but it still required a little bit of preparation. However, after having hiked Te Araroa trail in New Zealand this year, the whole hike suddenly felt like a much smaller project than I percieved it before, so I only had to find a few days of a decent weather window. When I got the idea about hiking the TMB for the first time, my idea was to try to do it in about four days and go as light as possible, which, in my mind, meant going just with a trail running west and staying in huts. But when I learnt a little bit more about the trail, I found out that the huts are usually fully booked several weeks/months in advance. True, I could have made a booking, but that wouldn't align with my idea of "semi-spontaneus" adventure, which is something that I really enjoy, so I decided that I will bring my tarp and I will be able to avoid problems with crowded huts. 

Isn‚Äôt it amazing to set off on an adventure at any moment, with every choice entirely in your hands? I love moving at my own pace. Some days I push further just because I feel like it, ending up traveling more kilometers that I anticipated that day in the morning. Or not having to rushed to reach the next accommodation, and letting the journey unfold naturally. I love the freedom to change my route on a whim, to pause and wait for the rain to pass, or to push through it and test my own determination. Every decision is mine, and in that freedom‚Äîthe thrill of choosing my path, moment by moment‚ÄîI find the purest joy.
