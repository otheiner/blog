Crossing the extremely muddy Longwood forrest was the first bigger trail tests and I passed it with honours. The next day, it was time to continue further. There were four days ahead of me, where I couldn't resupply any food, so this was another test. Looking at this after having finished the trail, this was nothing unusual and packing food for several days, or even a week, became something completely normal. However, at this point, this was something I had to learn. During my scooter expeditions, I didn't need to carry food for more than two days, becacuse I could cover almost 300 km in two days, which was sufficient for meeting some shop almost every day. Now, this wasn't the option. I quickly hitched from the trail to ressuply to the nearby town and back to the place where I finished hiking, so that I don't skip any part of the trail. The hitching was easy and I had a good chat both ways despite the fact that that, on the way to the town, I was picked up by a farmer from deer farm who was driving a car that had a shape which reminded me of a car of funneral service to transport coffins.
