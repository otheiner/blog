Hello stranger, 

I am Ondřej Theiner and this is my personal blog. Some people might ask why am I creating blog in the time of social media but my answer is simple. We all can probably agree that almost nobody reads long posts on Facebook or Instagram, so I decided to create this blog where I can write long posts that nobody reads. I am not indending to post things regularly but I might have something to say from time to time.

If you would like to know more about who I am professionally, you can go to my personal [webpage](https://otheiner.github.io/).
